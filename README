This software produced has been made for easier graph testing, graph route generation and route ranking.
Within the scope of the assignment, ALL PYTHON BUILT-IN Abstract Data Types are NOT allowed and only student 
made ADTs are allowed to be used. For more information on the task, please see the Assignment Brief Document.


=====================
## Contents
=====================
README - readme file for Assignment 1

## MAIN CODE
gameofcatz.py - Main software application for route ranking generation

## TEST HARNESS
ClassTestHarness.py - Test harness code that uses UnitTestModule.py to tests all class codes. Run this to run the testharness.

## MODULES
DSAGraph.py - Class files for DSA Graphs classes

HashTable.py - Class files for DSA Hash Tables classes

SQClasses.py - Code containing DSA Stacks and Queues classes

MinDynamicHeap.py - Code containing DSA Heap classes. This is a Min-based Heap that can dynamically adjust it's array size.

LinkedListClasses.py - Code containing DSA Linked List class

UnitTestModule.py - My unit test module built for unit testing.


=====================
## Dependencies
=====================
Module "numpy"
Module "sys"
Module "timeit"
Module "networkx"
Module "matplotlib"

Input Files - gameofcatz.txt, gameofcatz2.txt, gameofcatz3.txt
	  # Input files contain information about the graph

=====================
## Execution
=====================
Interactive Mode Usage: python3 gameofcatz -i 
Note: When running interactive mode, options 2, 3 and 4 in the menu are to be performed like the python interpreter 
	  (interactive command) mode. This may require you to call functions in the input via the built in pseudo-interpreter in 
	  gameofcatz.py. i.e.
	  d
	  >>> addVertex(B,5)
	  >>> removeVertex(B)
	  For more information, please read the provided report.
	  
Simulation Mode Usage: python3 gameofcatz.py -s <inputFile> <outputFile>
Note: Simulation Mode only generates routes. NOTE - If it returns "Unable to allocate X memory for array etc...",
	  please go into gameofcatz.py in the settings section and reduce the "defaultNumRoutes" value. This value dictates the maximum
	  amount of routes that can be generated in simulation mode.
